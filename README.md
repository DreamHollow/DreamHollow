- 👋 Hi, I’m @DreamHollow
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music, video games, mechanical engineering, reading, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning almost exclusively C++, but some C#, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, and possibly Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects when possible.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email.

I tend to fork repos that I am interested in contributing to at some point in the future.
