- 👋 Hi, I’m @DreamHollow
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, but mostly computers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at least 3 different programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects when possible.
- 📫 How to reach me: unless it's about a security vulnerability or you want to alter my code, do not.

I would also like to make it clear that I'm new to GitHub and Git push/pull/merge/commit systems in general.
